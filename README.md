# Silly Haiku server

A silly little HTTP server I wrote to learn some rust. It will serve you a
(very pseudo) pseudorandom Haiku.

# Building
I had to set the following on macOS to get the openssl crate to build:

```sh
export OPENSSL_INCLUDE_DIR=/usr/local/opt/openssl/include;
export DEP_OPENSSL_INCLUDE=/usr/local/opt/openssl/include;
```

# Deploying (Heroku)

```
cd path/to/this/repo
$ heroku login
$ heroku create --buildpack https://github.com/emk/heroku-buildpack-rust.git
$ git push heroku master
```
